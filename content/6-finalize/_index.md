In this final part, you will complete the end-to-end test of your music app—from local development to full cloud deployment. This ensures that your backend services (auth, playlists, tracks, etc.) are not only working in isolation but are also properly integrated with the frontend interface.

You will go through 3 key steps:

* 6.1. Run the UI locally – Test the Amplify-connected React app on your machine
* 6.2. Deploy the UI to S3 – Upload your compiled frontend to the Amplify web hosting bucket

These steps will help verify both functionality and deployment consistency across environments.
